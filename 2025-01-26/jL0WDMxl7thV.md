Here are the differences between the two files:

**iconfont.ttf**:

* **New file**: This file has been added to the repository.
* **Binary content**: The content of the file is binary, which is typical for font files.

**iconfont.woff**:

* **New file**: This file has been added to the repository.
* **Binary content**: Similar to the .ttf file, this file contains binary data.

**iconfont.woff2**:

* **New file**: This file has been added to the repository.
* **Binary content**: Like the .woff and .ttf files, this file contains binary data.

**layui.js**:

* **New file**: This file has been added to the repository.
* **Content**: The file contains JavaScript code related to the layui framework. It defines various functions and modules that are used for building web applications.
* **Imported modules**: The code imports several modules, including `layui.all`, `layui`, and `lay`.
* **Functionality**: The code appears to be a configuration file for the layui framework, setting various options and defining event handlers.

**Summary**:

The new files appear to be related to font and JavaScript code for the layui framework. The .ttf and .woff2 files likely contain font data, while the .woff file may be an older version of the font. The .js file appears to be a configuration file for the layui framework, which may be used to define options and event handlers for web applications.
