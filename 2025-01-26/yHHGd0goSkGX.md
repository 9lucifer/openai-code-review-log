* **Utils**: The `util` module provides various utility functions, such as data parsing, string manipulation, and date handling.

**Example of Module Loading**:

```javascript
layui.define(function(a) {
  var layer = layui.layer;
  var form = layui.form;
  // ... other modules ...

  a("layer", layer);
  a("form", form);
  // ... other modules ...
});
```

**Example of Event Handling**:

```javascript
layui.event.on("test", function(data) {
  console.log("test event triggered with data:", data);

```javascript
layui.use("layer", function() {
  layui.layer.open({
    title: "Hello World",
    content: "This is a layer dialog",
    btn: ["OK", "Cancel"],
    yes: function(index, layero) {
      layer.close(index);
    },
    btn2: function(index, layero) {
      layer.close(index);
    }
  });
});
```

**Conclusion**:

The changes to `layui.js` make the library more powerful and flexible, providing developers with more options for building web applications. The new features and improvements will likely make the `layui` library even more popular among web developers.
